# nand2tetris
My work on the nand2tetris (Elements of Computing Systems) MIT course http://www.nand2tetris.org/

The idea of the course is to build an entire computer system from the ground up, ie NAND gates, and eventually write
games to run on the system.

I didn't use git for the hardware chapters (I probably should have, at least towards the end), I added that stuff to the
repo as a back-up and for completeness.
